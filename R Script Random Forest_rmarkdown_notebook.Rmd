This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r Data File}
datafilename <-"Raw_data_final.csv"
datafolder <- "C:/Users/despm/OneDrive/Documents/My PhD Work/FINAL DATA WORK/"
datafile <- paste(datafolder, datafilename, sep="")
```

```{r}
rf <- randomForest(mid_spread~., data=train)
print(rf)
```

```{r}
str(mydata_selected)
```

```{r}

ind <- sample(2, nrow(mydata_selected), replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
train <- mydata_selected[ind==1,]
test <- mydata_selected[ind==2,]
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
plot(rf)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
